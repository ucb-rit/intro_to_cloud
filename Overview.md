# Overview of Intro the Cloud 

## Workflows with the Cloud 

- Virtual Machines act as on-demand, virtually-rented machines 
- Containers (*e.g. Docker*) allow workflows and applications to be deployed and shared easily 
- APIs provide an automated approach to pulling data and performing actions 
- Google Cloud Shell is a free Linux terminal that you can start using in minutes 

## Concepts   

- On-demand use of cloud resources is often fast and easy
- Resources that encourage reproducible science / workflows
