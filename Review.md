# Review 

## Workflows with the Cloud 

- Virtual Machines act as on-demand, virtually-rented machines 
- Containers (*e.g. Docker*) allow workflows and applications to be deployed and shared easily 
- APIs provide an automated approach to pulling data and performing actions 
- Google Cloud Shell is a free Linux terminal that you can start using in minutes 

## Concepts   

- On-demand use of cloud resources is often fast and easy
- Resources that encourage reproducible science / workflows

# Access and Grants 

This page contains dates and other important information for obtaining access and grants for various cloud providers. Nearly all commercial cloud providers offer limited free resources (always free tier) and free compute credits for first time users. 

Also see [this table that describes some of the cloud resources and the grants and free services they offer](https://github.com/ucb-rit/intro_to_cloud/raw/master/Cloud_Grants_and_Access.pdf).

## XSEDE Jetstream - NSF
* No cost option for interactive VMs.
* Offers VMs pre-built with MATLAB, RStudio, and Jupyter notebooks, Docker and Singularity.
* Allocations available through requests to XSEDE that start with a 24-hour turnaround for access.
